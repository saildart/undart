# undart
Convert Stanford A.I.Lab SAIL backup tape DART images into GNU/Linux files.
The undart README is in the long comment at the beginning of undart-2016.c
The program is self compiling at a bash shell command prompt, type: "source undart-2016.c"
which places a binary at /usr/local/bin/undart and details on finding the input data are
in the README comment .. and will be added here when I have mastered the GITHUB public and private
mechanism. Only samples of SAILDART are public.
This year's version undart-2016.c is last in the line of undart work - undart
is superceded by dart-flatten.c and dart-remix.c
